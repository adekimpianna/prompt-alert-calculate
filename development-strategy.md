# Development Strategy

> **Debugging Project Week 2: Prompt Alert Calculate**

This project is miming the function of a calculator, thus it has the function to add numbers, to subtract, to multiply and to divide. But not like a normal calculator, the user interaction is designed with prompt alerts where the users can insert the numbers they wish to process through the dialog box. 

There is nothing special about the design from this project because we are focusing on the javascript. However to see the connection among HTML, CSS and Javascript, it is necessary to create at least a way on the structure, such as HTML elements, to ensure the JavaScript code can be run through, and here we use `button` for that.
