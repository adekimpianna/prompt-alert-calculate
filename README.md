## Introduction
This project is miming the function of a calculator, thus it has the function to add numbers, to subtract, to multiply and to divide. But not like a normal calculator, the user interaction is designed with prompt alerts where the users can insert the numbers they wish to process through the dialog box.  
  
This is a homework project for module 3: Debugging in HFY, with a focus on JavaScript. This is a collaboration project in which each of collaborators takes part in solving the mystery of JavaScript in this project.  
  
**Starter Code** means that half of the codes are already written and we need to complete and finish it. Here we are needed *to write the functions and the user interactions (UI)* so that the project runs properly. 

### What are the goals?
This project assignment has two main goals: **integrating (using together html, css with JavaSCipt) and debugging goals**, in details:
* to _analyse the codes_: detect some errors or missing parts from the JavaScript codes
* to _fix the codes_: complete the missing parts or replace some errors found with the correct codes
* to _do self-test_, one by one, on the project through some browser debuggers or in JS Tutor 

### Who should do it?
* Anyone who is interested in Debugging
* Beginners in JavaScript, using function.

## Tools and Requirements
These are the tools we use here, but you are free to use your preferred tools :
* Visual Studio Code (any other coding apps)
* Gitkraken (optional, you can use any other clis)
* JS Tutor (no installation needed) or your own browser debugger.

**Requirements** It is suggested to first understand [how JavaScript works](https://javascript.info/first-steps), especially [functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics).
